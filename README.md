# friskabot
Bot that makes deciding where to eat a little bit easier. Also allows you to stay in the office and get someone else to do it.

Used in Slack:
* Add your order to a list of orders with `/friska order <YOUR ORDER>`
* Have a look at the soup of the day with `/friska soups`
* View all orders with `/friska view`
* Agree to take the orders. This wipes the list of current orders and gives you a list of who wants what with `/friska take orders`

**Example**

Look at the soups for today: `/friska soups`

Order your favoured soup with`/friska order tasty soup`

Someone else can then decide that they're feeling generous and agree to take the orders with `/friska take orders`. This will give them a list of current orders, then wipe the list for anyone else to prevent confusion.
